Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese hostilities towards the West have skyrocketed. This paper argues that these rising anti-western sentiments must be placed within the context of popular historical memory. Namely, international scrutiny over COVID-19’s origins brings to the forefront an enduring “siege mentality” whereby China perceives a West that continuously denigrates the Chinese populace as the “Sick Man of Asia”–frail, disease-ridden, and unsanitary. 

To qualify the importance of historical memory, this paper analyzes an extensive corpus of Weibo data through natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. By applying LDA topic modeling to Weibo posts mentioning the “Sick Man of Asia” during the early stages of the pandemic, it is possible to demonstrate that connotations surrounding this epithet has shifted from introspective self-criticism to an anti-western “siege mentality.” Moreover, Bayesian sentiment analysis of Weibo posts discussing COVID-19’s origins show that posts alluding to historical memory are significantly more emotionally-charged. 

While existing literature connects China’s rising anti-westernism during COVID-19 with a slew of factors ranging from ideological differences to feelings of “national superiority,” this paper argues that any explanation is incomplete without accounting for historical narratives rooted in health and biological insecurities.
